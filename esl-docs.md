### 7. Bluetooth Service Characteristic Value UUID

| Service characteristic value |
| --- |
| 0000fef0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb |

| Notify characteristic value |
| --- |
| 0000fef1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb |

### 8. Broadcast data analysis

manufacturerId value is 0x5053

| Manufacturer ID | BYTE0 | BYTE1 | BYTE2 | BYTE3 | BYTE4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0x5053 | Device Type (Table 1 Device Type)  <br>  <br>\[LOW\] | Battery voltage | Software Version | Hardware version | Device type (Table 1 Device type)  <br>  <br>\[HIGHT\] |

Note: The battery voltage is the measured voltage multiplied by 10. For example, 32 means the battery is 3.2V
